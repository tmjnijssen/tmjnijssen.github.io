Direct air capture (DAC) is an emerging technology to remove CO₂ from the atmosphere and help to quicker reach net zero emissions and limit global warming. DAC involves contacting large quantities of air with sorbent materials to capture CO₂, and subsequently using temperature and/or pressure adjustments to release it in a pure stream for storage or conversion. The energy efficiency of the contacting and release steps is of paramount importance to the viability of the DAC process. Therefore, pressure drop and heat losses in the air contactors must be minimised. In this project, we seek to understand and optimise the design of these devices.

In this PhD research, the fluid dynamics, heat and mass transfer processes in air contactors are investigated using multiphyisics computational methods. The optimal topology of the sorbent material to balance pressure drop and capacity is considered, and efficient heat transfer mechanisms for the desorption phase will be designed. This research will lead to an improved understanding of the air contactors, and design rules to be used for further scale-up.
