This project is focused on the modeling and simulation of advanced absorption technologies for CO₂ capture, with the objective of achieving process intensification and absorber size reduction. Using Aspen Plus for process simulation, the study examines and compares the performance of conventional packed bed columns alongside intensified configurations, including rotating packed beds, hollow fiber membrane absorbers, vortex absorbers, and the RotaScrub, developed by SDS Separation. The outcomes contribute to the development of compact, energy-efficient carbon capture systems that support global climate mitigation goals.
