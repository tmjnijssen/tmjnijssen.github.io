This month, Sebastiaan is starting his PhD project. He will look into the design and operation of air contactor devices for Direct Air Capture. We will perform multi-physics simulation of the coupled flow, heat transfer, and mass transfer to understand how we can improve the energy efficiency of these devices.

Good luck, Sebastiaan!
