This month, two students are starting their master's projects! Jop is part of the Energy, Flow and Process Technology master, and will perform a feasibility study on moisture-swing CO<sub>2</sub> capture for gas-fertilisation in greenhouses. Saartje comes from the Sustainable Energy Technology, and will investigate a new process route for integrated Direct Air Capture and CO<sub>2</sub> electrolysis, in collaboration with Iris Burgers, [Ruud Kortlever](https://www.kortlevergroup.com/), and Earl Goetheer.

I am very much looking forward to these projects!
