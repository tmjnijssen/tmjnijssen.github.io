As of today I am starting an exciting new journey! I am joining the group of prof.dr. Marcel Ottens at the department of Biotechnology in TU Delft. We will be working on understanding the hydrodynamics of Expanded Bed Adsorption. This is a novel down-stream processing method for biopharmaceutical products, where the clarification of the fermentation broth and capture of the target protein is combined in a single step. Using coupled Computational Fluid Dynamics and Discrete Element Method, we will investigate how the chromatographic resin beads move through the column, and how that will impact separation performance.

Very excited for this new challenge!
