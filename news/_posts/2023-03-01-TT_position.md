An exciting new chapter has opened up! I am joining the Process & Energy department at the faculty of Mechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineering (3mE), as an assistant professor on the hydrodynamics and thermodynamics of carbon capture and conversion process. As I am convinced of the utmost importance of battling climate change, I will be focusing my research on Direct Air Capture and negative emission processes. I am grateful for the confidence the department has vested in me, and excited for the work that lies ahead!
