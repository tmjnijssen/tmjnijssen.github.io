Magnetic Particle Tracking is an inexpensive, non-intrusive method for measuring particle behaviour in dense systems. However, reconstruction of data, i.e. obtaining the particle position from the sensor readings is quite a challenge because of non-linearities. Resulting from a little Friday afternoon discussion, Kay Buist and I developed a new algorithm for this. Our method relies almost entirely on algebraic steps, making it much quicker than previous numerical methods.
