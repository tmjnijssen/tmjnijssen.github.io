In this second article from my postdoc in biotechnology, we performed a parametric survey of column and material design parameters for an Expanded Bed Adsorption process. We found expected, but also plenty of unexpected behaviour. For example, we saw these slow swirling motions in the bed, which became more stable at increased viscosity. A big thanks to my co-authors, Johan Padding and Marcel Ottens!
