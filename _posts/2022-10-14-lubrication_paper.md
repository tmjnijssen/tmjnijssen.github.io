Lubrication forces massively impact the collisions of immersed particles, but how can we account for that in an unresolved simulation? That is the question Johan Padding, Marcel Ottens and I asked ourselves, but we could not find a coherent answer in the literature! That is why we wrote this short communication *A note on the modelling of lubrication forces in unresolved simulations*, in which we provide a unified method based on physics and previous experimental results.

Have a look: [10.1016/j.powtec.2022.118017](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.powtec.2022.118017)!
