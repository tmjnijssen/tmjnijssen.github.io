The 12th Trondheim Conference on Carbon Capture, Transport and Storage [TCCS12](https://www.sintef.no/projectweb/tccs-12/), organised by SINTEF and NTNU was a great place to talk everything CCS. Great talk by Marco Mazzotti, showing us the reality of the scale discrepancy between the fossil industry and the current CCS efforts. And of course, Norway is not at all a bad place to be, beautiful!
