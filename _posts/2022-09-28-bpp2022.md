Greetings from the beautiful and sunny Portugal! We are in Aveiro, for the Biopartitioning and Purification conference [BPP 2022](https://bpp2022.web.ua.pt/index.asp). I am presenting my work on CFD-DEM simulation of Expanded Bed Adsorption, showcasing to the biotechnology community what we can do with advanced numerical methods. A big thanks to the organisation!
