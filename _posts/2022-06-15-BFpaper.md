The last paper from my PhD work is available online today! *Large-scale VOF/CFD-DEM simulation of blast furnace hearth dynamics* got published in journal of the Iron and Steel Institute of Japan (ISIJ). We performed CFD-DEM simulations of the bottom part of the blast furnace, unique in their complexity and scale. Using the Dutch national supercomputer, we were able to simulate a 10m diameter furnace, involving over 4,000,000 particles, gas/liquid flow, mass and heat transfer. This truly gives us a unique look into the furnace.
