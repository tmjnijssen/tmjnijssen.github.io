I obtained my bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering and Chemistry from the Eindhoven University of Technology in 2015, followed by a master's degree in Chemical Process Technology from the same institute in 2017. After this, I started my PhD project in the Multiphase Reactors group of prof.dr.ir. J.A.M. (Hans) Kuipers. I have developed advanced 3-phase fluid dynamics simulations of the iron making blast furnace, and worked on experiments to validate the models. I defended my thesis "Dynamic behaviour of liquid-solid systems: Modelling and experiments applied to the blast furnace hearth" in November 2021.

After my PhD, I joined the group of prof.dr. M. (Marcel) Ottens at the department of Biotechnology of TU Delft for a postdoc project on Expanded Bed Adorption. I applied my experience in multiphase CFD the explore equipment and material design for process intensification in the purification of biopharmaceutical products. Since March 2023, I am in my current position at the department of Process & Energy (TU Delft), working on carbon capture and conversion processes. Next to my research and education, I am a board member of the <a href="https://osc-delft.github.io/" target="_blank" style="color: black;">Open Science Community Delft</a>.
